# binary_primes
Displays a list of prime numbers in color coded BCD format

Compile and run using:\n
\t$ gcc -o primes.o primes.c
\t$ ./primes.o

The color coding was tested on macOS, but should also work on Linux platforms.

The number of primes listed is cut off at 1000 due to my terminal history limitations.
